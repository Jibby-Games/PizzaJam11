# Overview
Theme - Awkward Situations For Men

You are a guy at a bar trying to find a free urinal to piss in, which isn't as easy as it sounds.
Obviously you can't piss next to someone else, OR if they're watching you


# Mechanics
2D top down similar to Hotline Miami
Bladder filling up - don't piss yourself or you get kicked out!
Pissing to empty bladder - don't miss too much or get kicked out!
Trousers only drop in the right spot - otherwise you piss yourself

# Levels
